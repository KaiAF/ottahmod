# OttahMod

This is one of my first Minecraft mods that I have developed. I wanted to add otters to the game after watching Minecraft's recent "Minecraft Live", where they announced otters for Minecraft Dungeons.

The reason why I named the mod "OttahMod" instead of "OtterMod" is because I like to say "Ottah". It just sounds cool ðŸ˜Ž.

## What do otters eat?

At the moment, in this mod, otters can be given raw cod and tadpoles in a bucket. This will gain the trust of the otter.

### Development

There are many features that are missing with the otter, like, proper animations. I plan to work on them at my own pace!
The end-goal is to have a proper Minecraft mob that feels like a brand-new vanilla addition to the game.
